# 🧑‍💼 HR Employee Attrition Analytics Platform

End-to-end data analytics project identifying the key drivers of employee attrition — from
raw, messy HR data to a cleaned dataset, SQL-driven insights, Python EDA, and an interactive
live dashboard.

**🔗 Live Dashboard:** [Add your Streamlit Cloud link here after deployment]
**📁 Dataset:** 1,470 employees · same schema as the well-known IBM HR Analytics dataset

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project simulates a real HR analyst workflow at a mid-sized company:

1. **Excel** — Explored and cleaned raw employee data (removed duplicates, fixed
   inconsistent text formatting, imputed missing values, dropped constant columns), built a
   KPI summary using live formulas (`COUNTIFS`, `AVERAGEIF`) and a department-level
   attrition-rate breakdown with chart.
2. **SQL (PostgreSQL)** — Designed a single denormalized employee table (the natural shape
   for this data — a deliberate modeling choice, not a missed star schema) and wrote 18
   analysis queries covering department, role, overtime, satisfaction, tenure, income, travel,
   and combined risk-factor breakdowns.
3. **Python (Pandas/Seaborn)** — Performed exploratory data analysis, validated the cleaning
   logic, and visualized the strongest attrition drivers.
4. **Power BI** — Built an interactive multi-page dashboard with DAX measures for attrition
   rate, high-risk employee counts, and segment-level breakdowns.
5. **Streamlit** — Deployed a live, filterable web dashboard so anyone can explore the
   findings without opening any local tool.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **OverTime is the single strongest attrition driver** — employees working overtime leave at
  **37.6%** vs **22.1%** for those who don't (nearly 1.7x).
- **First-year employees are the highest flight risk** — **38.3%** attrition in year one,
  declining steadily to **19.4%** for 10+ year veterans.
- A small **"High Risk" segment** — employees working overtime **with** low/medium job
  satisfaction — is only **9% of the workforce** but represents the highest-leverage group for
  a targeted retention conversation.
- **Department-level attrition is fairly uniform** (~20–27%) — the cause is not team-specific;
  it's distributed across individual working conditions present in every department.
- **Frequent travelers (32.7%) and long commutes (30.4%)** both show elevated attrition,
  pointing toward flexible-work policy as a cost-effective retention lever.

*(See `notebooks/hr_attrition_eda.ipynb`, `sql/`, and `powerbi/DASHBOARD_ANALYSIS.md` for the
full analysis behind these findings.)*

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hr-attrition-analytics.git
cd hr-attrition-analytics
```

### 2. Regenerate the dataset (optional — already included as CSVs)
```bash
pip install pandas numpy faker
python data/generate_data.py
python data/clean_data.py
```

### 3. Load into PostgreSQL
```bash
psql -U postgres -d hr_db -f sql/01_schema.sql
psql -U postgres -d hr_db -c "\copy employees FROM 'data/hr_attrition_clean_for_sql.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true)"
psql -U postgres -d hr_db -f sql/02_analysis_queries_part1.sql
```

### 4. Run the Jupyter notebook
```bash
pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib seaborn
jupyter notebook notebooks/hr_attrition_eda.ipynb
```

### 5. Run the Streamlit dashboard locally
```bash
cd dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### 6. Build the Power BI dashboard
Open `powerbi/POWERBI_BUILD_GUIDE.md` for the full step-by-step guide (import data → add DAX
measures → build report pages). For the verified business findings to present alongside the
dashboard, see `powerbi/DASHBOARD_ANALYSIS.md`.

## 🌐 Deploying the Live Dashboard (Streamlit Community Cloud — Free)

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) → sign in with GitHub
3. Click **New app** → select this repo → set main file path to `dashboard/app.py`
4. Click **Deploy** — the dashboard already includes its own copy of the cleaned dataset at
   `dashboard/data/hr_attrition_clean.csv`, so no extra path configuration is needed.
5. You'll get a public URL like `https://your-app.streamlit.app`
6. Add that URL to the top of this README and to your resume/LinkedIn project section

## 📝 Resume Bullet (ready to use)

> Analyzed employee attrition patterns across 1,470 records using SQL, Python, and Power BI;
> identified overtime and low job satisfaction as the top attrition drivers (37.6% vs 22.1%
> attrition rate) and isolated a high-risk segment representing 9% of the workforce, deploying
> a live interactive dashboard with actionable retention insights.
